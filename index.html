        <p class="n1">A shoe is not only a design, but it's a part of your body language, the way you walk. The way you're going to move is quite dictated by your shoes.</p>
        <p class="n2">The thing I always try to remember is that feet are attached to the leg, and that you must prolong the silhouette. The shoe elongates the leg and does it discreetly. The goal is to get people to look at a woman's legs. It's all about the leg. No, it's not about the leg. It's about the woman and You need to clean it up in order to impress her or anybody. <br>Clean Shoes truly reflects somebody's personality.</p>
